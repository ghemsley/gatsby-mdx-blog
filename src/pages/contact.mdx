    <p>
      If you would like to get in touch with me, please take a look at the
      social media and email icons I placed on the site header or sidebar.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you aren't sure where an icon is going to take you, hover over it with your
      mouse or long-press if you're on mobile.
      <br />
      <br />
      The email icon should open your device's default mail handler and begin an
      email to me, or you can optionally get in touch through any of the social
      media platforms that you find icon links to on the site header or sidebar
      as well. Please don't abuse these links.
