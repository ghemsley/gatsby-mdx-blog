Hello! My name is Graham, and I'm an aspiring web developer currently taking classes to learn more about how to build cool stuff on the web.
You've happened upon a blog I maintain so I can document my learning process, mainly for fun and the ability to look back on my growth. 

I hope you find something interesting while you're here!

If you want to know a little more about me, let's see, I like computers, cameras, coding, and coffee, not necessarily in that order.
I like practicing photography in my spare time, whenever I get the chance. You might someday find some photos I've taken here on this site.

When I finish with my studies, I hope to someday write software for a nonprofit agency that helps people out in some meaningful way.

I'd love to hear from anyone who lands on my blog about coding related stuff, or you can just let me know how the weather is where you live or something if you want. Really! I'd love to hear from you no matter what the topic. You can use the email button at the top or side of the page :)


Thanks for stopping by!
