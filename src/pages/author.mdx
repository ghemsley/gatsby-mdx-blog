Hello! My name is Graham, and I'm an aspiring web developer currently taking classes to learn more about how to build cool stuff on the web.
You've happened upon a blog I maintain for a course I'm taking. I hope you find something interesting while you're here!


If you want to know a little more about me, let's see, I like computers, cameras, coding, and coffee, not necessarily in that order.
I like practicing nature photography in my spare time, whenever I get the chance.

You might find some photos I've taken here on this site.
If you like them, feel free to use them for anything you want. Same goes with any code I write here, if it helps you out, feel free to use it without attribution.
But if you do appreciate something I've left here, I would love to hear about it (maybe in the comments you'll find on one of my posts, or my contact page?)

When I finish with my studies, I hope to someday work for a nonprofit agency that helps people out in some meaingful way.
If for some reason you have some kind of business or professional inquiry, please feel free to get in touch on the Contact page.
I'd love to hear from anyone who lands on my blog about coding related stuff, or you can just let me know how the weather is where you live or something if you want. Really!
I'd love to hear from you no matter what the topic.

Not sure what else to say here so I'll just say thanks for stopping by!
