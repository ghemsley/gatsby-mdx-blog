<div className='blog-post-content'>

  This blog is a student project intended to showcase things the author has been learning and doing during their
  time attending Flatiron School, a software engineering bootcamp with locations spanning the United States.
  The author is taking a course that requires a blog be written, so the author decided one day that it would be fun
  to build their own blog to satisfy that requirement.

  This blog was built using various technologies including NodeJS, React, Gatsby, MDX, GraphQL, SakuraCSS, and Netlify.
  There will somedxay be a guide on how to set up your own similar blog from scratch using those technologies posted here. For now,
  if you are interested in building something similar, check out the Gatsby Getting Started guide.

  The author is sharing stories and information with the hopes that someone will find it useful or interesting.
  If you have feedback for the author, please don't hesitate to get in touch. There is a contact page on the sidebar
  providing methods for getting in touch with the author.

  The blog and its content is intended for educational purposes. If you see code written here by the author that does not belong
  to any other project, please feel free to use it with the assumption that it is governed by the MIT software license.

  On a related note, if you see something here that the author is using that they should not be, please let the author know using
  one of the methods on the Contact page.
