## Why I am studying software engineering

I'm going to be a little honest with my audience and say that I am currently going through a difficult time. I struggle with depression at times, and right now I am experiencing a very tough situation outside of school and it's all making it very hard to write at the moment. So, this post might end up a little bland, or it might at least lack my usual energy. But I realize that this sort of thing I'm experiencing is actually related to why I want to study software engineering.

## A goal I've long had

I have experienced struggles with depression like this since I was a young child. At the same time, since I was very little, I always loved working with computers. One of my earliest memories is of trying to figure out how to launch games on an MS-DOS computer. I learned fairly young how to build them, how to fix them, and for a while have been trying to teach myself how to program them. They're just fun to mess around with for me. Also at a young age, I realized that I would enjoy doing something with them in a professional capacity someday, if I could. And I realized that I wanted to help people who experience struggles similar to the ones that I have known for such a long time too. So for me, studying software engineering is a step along the path towards realizing those two goals at once. In fact, while there may be other paths I could take towards trying to give back, I really think software engineering is the best route for me personally. I will try to explain why that is.

## Software can help people make a difference

One reason I found is that software engineering lends itself naturally to helping make nearly any type of difference you want to make. I think of software as a kind of force multiplier for whatever task it's applied towards. If there is something you want to achieve, software can probably help you or someone else achieve it. There will always be a need or a use for it in practically every field nowadays. This includes fields that contribute towards the effort to help those suffering from mental health struggles. Say there is a nonprofit that provides social work services for those in need. This organization probably needs marketing, a website, IT services, business software, etc. Maybe its mission could even be served by having an in-house software engineering team to develop apps for its clients to use. Software engineering touches all of those problems, and probably more. The limit to what software can help facilitate is imagination.

## You can start small and work your way up

Another reason I think software engineering is right for me to study is that, at least for the problems I am talking about, it scales well to fit whatever size difference you are ready to make. There are some ideas that I could potentially realize in the near future that could make a material, if small, impact on the problems I want to help with. Say that a charity needed part of its website fixed, or a small non-profit needed a simple web app built. Depending on their requirements, I can already do that as a volunteer. With more training, my reach extends and my impact becomes larger. Soon I hope to be more knowledgable, and have what it takes to get hired as a software engineer at a company that can provide more comprehensive services for organizations in need. In such a role, I might just be a part of a team, but as a team, what we can provide becomes larger, as does the potential difference we could make.

## Writing software is fun and interesting to me

Finally, for me, software engineering is an especially sustainable way to contribute because my experience so far is that it is _fun_. I often enjoy messing with computers all day and staring at a screen full of code. As someone who struggles with depression, this attribute of the profession is important. I need to feel like I am learning, or doing something useful, or solving an interesting problem. Otherwise, my depression worsens. Software engineering is a field full of opportunities to do these things. While maybe not every problem or day of work will be as interesting as the last, I feel it would be a way of contributing that I would often genuinely enjoy. If I were a software engineer, I think I would be able to mix meaningful work with a pleasurable activity and hopefully truly satisfy my desire to contribute and feel productive in a sustainable way. In this way, it seems quite ideal as a field of study for me.

## Wrapping up

Hopefully these reasons make as much sense to you as they make to me. I am very confident that I am working towards something important. I hope that when I am finished with my studies at school, I will be able to begin proving it through making contributions to my community and to projects that are important to me. The end of my studies will be just the beginning of my journey as a software engineer, and it's a journey that seems at once exciting, challenging, and even a little frightening at this stage, but I believe at the same time that it will end up being wholly worthwhile.
